    0: 'Goodly reader, in this story you will take the role of Gregory, a curious and youthful gentleman of British birth living in an ambiguous city in 19th century France. And while this story is indeed adventurous — lest its very subtitle be criminally misleading! — you must bear in mind that you, Gregory, are more acquainted with absinthe and vice than firearms and acrobatics.</br>But you will venture forth with empty hands or pockets; we shall not allow you to be so underprepared! At the beginning of this tale you are wearing a fashionable, if cheap, suit — complete with black wool overcoat and starched-felt bowler. You have a pocket watch on a chain. But this is no ordinary pocket watch; this pocket watch has been over-wound and is in need of repair. Your wallet is empty of money; they seem to have taken it all at the bar. In one hand you bear a simple, bronze-headed cane of stained wood, born as an affectation. In your trousers pocket you have a silver ring that you won in a game of chance, a ring that you were hoping to give to your lover. And of course, you would not consider leaving your chamber without an ample supply of intoxicants, which may be found in various flasks and bottles upon your person. It is with these provisions that you begin your absinthe-muddled journey into the depths of the undercity.</br>This book, as you may have conjectured, does not read like a normal book. This book is not constrained by the limits of linear form. You will be allowed to make choices.</br>I won\'t lie to you; some of the choices may very well lead you to your death — or to fates still worse! The honest thing to do, of course, when you reach such an end would be to admit defeat. However, it is important to remember that this is just a book.</br>',
    1: 'The clock tower above your apartment tolls, ringing twice. You sit in your bedroom, which serves as your salon, which serves as your dining room and kitchen, which serves, quite unfortunately, as your water closet. The rain is pooling on the floor by the leaky window, and the wind is rushing through the alley outside with such force that your meager curtains billow and sway.</br>The green-tinted bottle lies empty at your tired feet, but you are not prepared to sleep. There are letters unanswered, and what sort of gentleman would you be if you delayed in your correspondence?</br>After the tolling of the bells, you hear a most curious sound, a sound quite unfamiliar to you. It is the sound of an iron gate perhaps, scraping and squealing from disuse. Or it is the sound of a dozen dogs of hell, scratching their claws of steel on the stone of their prison, howling towards the setting moon. But one thing is certain of the noise: it came from the stairwell right outside your door.</br>',
    2: 'You turn your eyes back to the letter before you, but your mind refuses to follow. Untamed, it thinks only of the gateway to hell that must surely have opened so close at hand, setting unimaginable beasts into the mortal realm. You turn the letter to your lover into a macabre poetry, one that references demons you did not realize you put stock in. The letter to your patron—as the middle-class banker who pays your rent would like to consider himself —is woefully incoherent, and is certain to convince him of your madness.</br>The wind and rain fall silent, and your room has never felt so ominous. The simple lock on the door suddenly seems inadequate, and—as much as you hate to admit it—you begin to question your own courage. You wish another soul were present in the room with you, for even the devils of the ninth hell may seem bearable when you\'ve a friend.</br>',
    3: 'The lamp seems to be out, and the stairwell is dark but for the orange glow that seeps in from the streetlights outside. You pause, letting your eyes adjust to the darkness, and close your door quietly behind you, locking it. </br>At the base of the steps, a floor below you, lies a dark bundle. To your mind it may be a rucksack, or a child. An imp, or a pile of laundry. It does not move.</br>Coming from the belfry upstairs, you hear the unmistakable sound of conflict: heavy breathing and boots clacking on the hardwood. Or perhaps it is the dancing of cloven-hoofed demons?</br>',
    4: 'An hour passes, an hour during which every howl of wind seems to be the wailing of a banshee, an hour that seems interminable. Eventually, after you\'ve calmed yourself with brandy and lie in a drunken near-slumber, the bells above chime thrice. On the third bell, you hear the noise once more. This must be the closing of the door, you rationalize, and soon you pass into dreamless sleep.</br>The next noon you awake, your head set afire by the toxins of vice, your palms bearing clear marks where your nails had dug in. You don your hat and begin to walk to the library. You need a book to read, to be certain, but not this one.</br>',
    5: 'You make your way up the steps, placing your feet near the walls to minimize the creak of the wood, your cane held at your side as a cudgel. Three flights up you walk, past stained-glass windows of undecipherable biblical scenes. The occasional squeak or scratch you make is drowned out by the cacophony of footsteps above.</br>Light filters down the steps from the doorless archway at the top of the stairs. When you reach the belfry, you rub your eyes in disbelief. Certainly, you assure yourself, it is some trick of the wormwood, and the small, green figures before you simply do not exist.</br>But there they are. The belfry is filled with goblins, their long rabbit ears hanging back over their heads, or cocked to strange angles, projecting through their black leather or felt caps. There must be dozens of them filling the small room, each with a unique patchwork outfit; some seem to be workmen and workwomen—perhaps they would be best known simply as workgoblins—in sturdy, functional coveralls, while others are a bizarre parody of your own suited attire, complete with bowler or top hat.</br>Yet while they dangle from rafters with ruler and knife, examine the bells with tuning fork and soundhorn, and scurry about with clipboard and blueprint, they do not appear to be in the process of repairing or maintaining the bell-tower at all. Instead, they appear to constructing some device of their own. It is obvious they have just begun, yet already they have arranged the metal skeleton of some unfathomable machine.</br><img src="images/5.png" alt=""></br>As you gape, you hear a high-pitched voice, speaking clear but accented English. "Pardon, sir, but you might want to wipe your chin."</br>"I\'m sorry?" you ask, and look about confused. You look down and see a clipboard-wielding goblin, who reaches hardly to your knee, offering up a handkerchief.</br>"Your chin. You seem to have leaked. I think if you kept your mouth closed, or perhaps open a bit less wide?"</br>Confused, you take the proffered kerchief and wipe your face</br>',
    6: 'You creep down the steps, one hand on the banister and the other on your cane. When you reach the ground floor, you realize that the stone staircase has a quite unnatural door set into it that you don\'t for the life of you remember, one that gapes darkness and seems sized for but a child.</br>And on closer inspection, you realize that the bundle on the floor is not a bundle at all, but is instead a miniature green man. One with long, floppy ears and tufts of white hair protruding at all angles from his wrinkled scalp. You stare, presuming the prone figure to be asleep or unconscious, until you realize that he stares right back at you, his eyelids open a slit to reveal dark eyes.</br>"Come no closer, gnome," you say, holding your cane before you as though it alone would hold back demons from the nethers.</br>But as soon as he hears your words, the creature springs forward, lunging towards you and... and crawls between your legs to cower behind you.</br>"Where?" he asks in a frightened voice. "Where are the gnomes? I cannot see them."</br>Something in his demeanor—perhaps it is his obvious fear that outweighs even your own—puts you at ease and you shake your legs free of him. "I, well... I thought you were a gnome."</br>/"Of course not! I take offense to such comments."</br>"And you are..." you question the man whose eyes meet your kneecaps.</br>"A\'gog" he replies, walking slowly up a few steps before turning and facing you at belt-level.</br>"Fascinating," you reply, because you\'ve never before met such a lucid creature while dreaming. "I\'ve never even heard of a gog. Where do gog\'s come from?"</br>The olive-green fellow jumps up and stamps his feet on the step. "My name is A\'gog. A\'gog the goblin. I am a goblin, and like any goblin from the undercity, the gnomes are my sworn enemies." A wistful look finds its way into A\'gog\'s eye and he begins to head off on a tangent. "Well, not that the gnomes know we are their sworn enemies. They just think that we work for them. Now, a few couple generations back, in my grandgoblin\'s time..."</br>You stare at him, curious, but he seems to have lost his train of thought.</br>"Well then, A\'gog. My name is Gregory, and I\'m the caretaker of this tower." This last bit isn\'t the sort of truth you\'d really want to call truth perse. "I admit I\'m rather quite curious what you\'re doing here, where this door came from, and what the racket above our heads is all about."</br>"And right you would be to be curious! There\'s great work afoot, great work indeed!" A\'gog comes down from his perch and circles you six times clockwise then six times counterclockwise. "I\'ve spelled you good. You are now obliged to take hand in our rescue."</br>"Am I really?" you ask, because you\'re not certain you believe him.</br>"Yes, of course. It\'s one of those geas curse magic spells that you humans believe in. It\'s where I trick you into thinking that if you don\'t come and do some task, what probably with some kind of shiny reward, you\'ll turn into a goose and be eaten by your fellows. So then, into the underworld! Us goblins need your help!"</br>"And if I don\'t help?"</br>"Well then, my magic curse will turn you into a goose in three days time, that\'s what\'ll happen to you." </br>"Will it really?" "No."</br>You sit down on the stones and pull a flask from your hatband. Sipping on spirits usually does you a bit of good in these sorts of situations. Well, you\'ve never been in quite this sort of situation, but it turns out that the gin does, indeed, help. </br>"Spare a swallow of that for an old goblin?" A\'gog asks, and you pass him the flask. </br>"So well, maybe you\'re not cursed or geased or liable to get goosed. But see I\'ll lay it out plain as a planet: we goblins got it bad, real bad. Us and the kabouters—big blind fellows with pasty-white skin and a screech like a bat, you\'d like \'em—we ain\'t been treated like we deserve to be treated. The gnomes have us at lightriflepoint, they do. I\'d rather be dead, I figure. </br>"We\'ve got plans, real good ones and real big ones, to be free. I can\'t say as I know you enough to trust you with the real working going on above our heads though. But we\'re building stuff that\'ll help. Weapons, let\'s say. And I thought I\'d come with, but of course I decided to take a nap down here since I was getting sorta tired, and now they\'ve all gone ahead and started without me and I don\'t really have a role in this no more. I\'m going to go back through that doorway into a dark world of violence, death, and steam-powered contraptions. You can either come with me—be a hero, or at least another fellow with a good-sized stick—or you can go back up into your little room up there and do whatever it is you were doing with your life, and I promise you you\'ll never have another chance to see a world aside from your own."<</br>The goblin burps, then giggles, yellow sharp teeth protruding from black gums. The laughter sets him off hiccupping, and eventually he falls over on his side in chuckles.</br>',
    7: '"Right then, geese or no geese, I\'ll follow you into the dark nethers. I have just one question for you, first."</br>"What\'s that?" A\'gog asks, calming down from his laughter, but still hiccupping.</br>"Am I hallucinating this?"</br>"No, I don\'t figure you are."</br>"But you\'re so short, and green, and well–" you search for the right word.</br>"Hallucinatey?"</br>"That\'ll do."</br>"Well I suppose I think I\'ve been around for decades now, being a rather old goblin. But if I was a product of your imagination, would I know it?"</br>"I don\'t know."</br>"Well, I\'m glad that\'s settled," A\'gog says, as if anything were settled.</br>He leads you into the doorway and down a steep flight of rather obnoxiously short and tightly-packed stairs. Of course, you can\'t see a thing, but years of stumbling home blind-drunk have taught you a thing or two about feeling your way across treacherous terrain without the use of your eyes.</br>In fact, you only stumble forward into your guide once during the course of the whole fifteen minute descent.</br>Eventually, you find yourself in a reasonably well-lit service tunnel that, while tall enough to accommodate you, is packed with tubes, pipes, and apparatus.</br>"Which way?" you ask, because A\'gog has stopped.</br>"Heavens if I know," he says. "I guess it depends on what you want to do."</br>And you had presumed that he had some sort of plan for you.</br>"Well, I think you\'ve got three options. There\'s us goblins, and we mostly live over that way, in Haddlelint. We\'re like slaves, and we mine stuff. We also engineer and invent and do all sorts of things that gnomes don\'t think we know how to, but mostly we just mine. We\'re staging an attack, too.</br>"Then you\'ve got the kabouters, over in Underburg—now that\'s not what they call it, but it\'s what we like to call it. The kabouters they\'re like... Idon\'t know what you call \'em up there, but you know, what do you call a snotty fellow who lives outside the city in a fancy little town and has a bit more money than the factory workers but still doesn\'t have any say in how anything works?"</br>"A sod," you offer.</br>"Yeah, that\'s them. Most of them don\'t even know they\'re slaves. You could go there, talk some sense into them. You\'d at least get to eat better. Either way would help us, I suppose. Both ways you\'re liable to end up killed."</br>"You said you thought I had three options?"</br>"Oh, right. Well, you could just walk right up to the gnomes in Hak\'kal, their metropolis. But you don\'t want to do that. Forget I brought it up."</br>',
    8: 'You take your flask back from your quickly inebriated friend, get to your feet, doff your cap, and return to your chamber without saying goodbye to the hallucinatory little fellow. The storm outside seems to have subsided, and you sit down before your desk, anxious to get on with whatever it is you were doing.</br>But there, sitting on your desk, is a nether-demon of insufferable agony, poorly disguised as a household cat. It looks up at you, its white fur glistening, and you realize it must have snuck in the window.</br>"Well aren\'t you an insufferable bore?" the demon asks.</br>"Well you see, I couldn\'t go and have an adventure," you defend yourself. "These letters, I am behind on my correspondence. What would my friends think?"</br>"I thought better of you, dear reader," the furious-hell-beast says calmly. "You don\'t deserve to read this book."</br>The fiend of the underworld transforms into a hideous manticore—which is just some ugly mix-match of annoying animals like humans and lions and scorpions—and kills you in a rather painful way, one that honestly you probably wouldn\'t want to hear about. You see, if I told you how it was that you were killed, you might, I don\'t know, have a sense of adventure. And clearly, that isn\'t what you want. So you\'re just dead.',
    9: '"My good sir goblin," you begin.</br>"Please, call me Yi\'ta."</br>"Right then, Yi\'ta. I happen to live in the apartment below, and I heard a noise that struck me as quite curious, the opening of some sort of gate, perhaps. And thusly, I ventured to discover its source."</br>Yi\'ta grins, revealing a mouth full of yellow-white canine teeth that burst forth from black gums. "Ah, yes. Curiosity... humans are quite curious, I have read. We have a saying, \'curiosity killed the human.\'"</br>"Cat." Another goblin, with patchwork overalls and an uncovered head of short, tufty hair peeks from around the bell she cling to and corrects Yi\'ta. "Curiosity killed the cat. Hubris killed the human."</br>"Right, right."</br>You intercede: "I admit I\' near dying to know what you\'re constructing up here."</br>"Of course," Yi\'ta answers, staring at his clipboard and making some notes. "What we have here is a sonalopticloopticamplificator. Nothing special, really, in its construction, but its purpose," Yi\'ta looks up and catches your eye with his own, "its purpose is to free our people."</br>The workgoblin from the bell saunters over and whispers into Yi\'ta\'s ear. Yi\'ta nods, and the workgoblin looks at you once more.</br>"We could use your help," Yi\'ta says.</br>"I\'m afraid I\'ve never been much for mechanical construction," you admit.</br>"There are other ways you could help us."</br>"Very well then," you say, because you certainly had nothing more interesting to do. "How may I be of service?"</br>"Three ways, really. You see, we goblins are preparing for revolution. We\'ve tried every peaceful method in our power to be free of the gnomes, but to no avail. We could use your help up here: as a human, you would be the perfect messenger for contacting our fellows in the other city towers. Or you could venture below, to the gnomish city of Hak\'kal, and beseech them for liberty on our behalf. Finally, if you\'d like, we could use another pair of arms to swing a club when, all other options explored, the great goblin army ascends upon the gnomes."</br>"Descends," you say, attempting to correct the fellow.</br>"Pardon?"</br>"An army descends upon a foe, not ascends."</br>"No, no, the goblin camps are quite a bit below Hak\'kal."</br>',
    10: '"Now see here," you say, holding your cane in a manner most unbefitting a gentleman, "I\'ll have none of this. You may not go about constructing any sort of device, machine, contraption, or gadget without written permission from the landlord."</br>"I\'m sorry to hear you say that," says the goblin at your feet. "Hey Gu\'dal," he shouts towards the rear of the room, "we\'ve got breach of etiquette to concern ourselves with."</br>Every goblin pauses in their work for a single moment and stares over at you, some in disbelief, some in anger, others with what appears to be amusement. It suddenly occurs to you that, hallucinations or no, the critters outnumber you remarkably.</br>One lanky goblin works her way through the room, wearing a fine suit and tie, her ears hidden under a comically large and narrow top hat, a top hat so tall that it reaches nearly to your waist when it sits atop her head. But any hint of comedy is thrown aside quite soon as she draws a sword from her cane and approaches.</br>"Good sir, it is impolite to interrupt the work of gnomes, goblins, or kabouters. In our culture, this simply is not done. If you have objection to our activities, you should have filed it with us before the work began." Her voice is measured and polite, but the blade, while scarcely longer than a steak knife, seems quite threatening in her hands.</br>',
    11: '"Madam, I meant no offence at all. I\'m afraid your customs are... unfamiliar to me," you say.</br>"It\'s not me you need to apologise to. It\'s Yi\'ta here, and everyone else, really. You\'re going to have to apologise to them."</br>"All of them?"</br>"All of them."</br>By twos and threes, each goblin takes leave of their measuring, hammering, tuning, and sawing to shake your hand and accept your apology. For each, you are required to explain the nature of your error, the depths of your sorrow, and the great degree to which you are humbled to be in their presence. With almost two-score of the little folk in the room, nearly a half-hour goes by.</br>"Now then," Yi\'ta, the original goblin, says, "you have made your hubris known to us, and we will have no more of your intrusions. We will not be guiding you into our underworld, a world that may have delighted and intrigued you. Tonight, you will not be embarking on an adventure that will change your life in a thousand ways. And if you speak of us, in the word either spoken or written, you will hang in this very tower by your entrails." Yi\'ta smiles at you, a mouth full of tiny daggers.</br>You take your leave and return to your apartment. Tomorrow, you will begin to look for different housing. It does not pay to insult the goblinkin, it appears.',
    12: '"Good, good," Yi\'ta says. "Although I admit I\'m a bit disappointed that we might not get to try out the sonalopticloopticamplificator. But we\'ll finish building it nonetheless, and if you fail at your task, we should have another opportunity in about six months. Six months might seem like a long time to you, of course, but we goblins are quite long-lived."</br>"Oh?" you ask, "what is a goblin\'s lifespan?"</br>"Why, the average goblin will live to be twenty-five, but we have on record goblins living up to the age of 37." Yi\'ta clearly expects you to be impressed, and you decide to feign amazement rather than inform him of your own lifespan. And besides, the life expectancy for a poverty-stricken, depressive absinthe drunk like yourself is surely not much greater than that of a goblin.</br>"Anyhow, I think you might do well with company to show you the way to Hak\'kal, yes? And I know just the goblin for the task. If there isn\'t to be a battle this morning we won\'t be needing her services anyhow." Yi\'ta turns to face the workgoblins. "Gu\'dal!"</br>A tall—well, tall for a goblin—and well-dressed goblin woman saunters up to you. She\'s got a thin, stretched look to her that extends up into her skinny top hat. She\'s twirling a cane and wearing a tailcoat. And when she speaks, she sounds like a talking bird. "Yi\'ta?" she says when she approaches the two of you.</br>"If you could, I\'d love for you to take..." Yi\'ta looks back to you, "What is your name, sir? My manners must be in one of these pockets somewhere, because I obviously can\'t find them."</br>"Gregory," you say.</br>"Yes. I\'d love for you to take Gregory here down below and show him to the gates to Hak\'kal. He\'s going to speak on our behalf to the gnomes."</br>"No rebellion tonight?" Gu\'dal asks.</br>"No, no. We\'re going to try again peacefully."</br>Gu\'dal looks at you and grimaces. Previously, you had thought the smile of a goblin was disconcerting. "Alright, poltroon-pants. You don\'t mind that I call you poltroon-pants, do you?"</br>You look at her teeth and decide that yes, poltroon-pants is acceptable.</br>"Okay, I\'ll take you to the gates. Then you can do your talking. But if you think that talking to gnomes is safer than bashing them with wrenches,you\'re in for a bit of a surprise."</br>With no further words, Gu\'dal turns and heads down the stairs.</br>A bit flustered, you follow. You take one last look at the door of your apartment, an apartment that has provided you such health and comfort.</br>Whatever object had lain upon the floorboards at the base of the steps is gone now, and as you reach the ground floor you realize that there is a goblin-sized doorway set into the side of the stairs. Through it, you see only blackness.</br>Gu\'dal reaches her hand out to yours as she steps through the portal. You grasp it, and realize it is not as clammy as you thought it might be. She leads you down another flight of stairs in darkness.</br>After what feels like twenty minutes, you emerge from the side of a stone hallway that is lit by gas lamps set into sconces along the top. Fortunately, the ceiling is a good foot over your head. Steam pipes of various diameters and metals run the length of the hallway.</br>Your path slopes slightly in front of you, taking you deeper into the ground. As you walk along the corridor, you notice dozens of nooks and crannies brimming with strange machinery. Some of it—heating apparatus, water-pressure regulators, and ventilation fans—you recognize. But some of it is completely foreign to you: there are light-refracting crystals embedded into steam-engine bits; there are sets of tuning forks that linger on chords, some sonorous, some atonal. Most of it appears to be powered by the steam pipes that line the halls.</br>',
    13: '"Well I suppose I don\'t want to hang out with a bunch of pasty sods, now do I?" you say to A\'gog. "What\'s say I come with you back to Haddlelint and we\'ll see what there is for a fellow like me to do."</br>A\'gog grabs your hand and takes off at a bounding pace, forcing you to jog to keep up. "So, you any good with a gun?" he asks.</br>"Well, er, I can\'t say that I\'ve too much experience in the matter," you respond, panting.</br>"What about strategy? You humans get into wars all the time, yeah?" "Well, not so much myself personally, you understand," you demur.</br>Demurring is particularly hard, by the way, since you are running at a decent clip and are forced to take several seconds between each word you utter.</br>"Whaddya get into then, up in your tower, if it isn\'t guns and strategizing?"</br>"Poems," you say, then stop running and lean against the wall of the tunnel. "I write poems. Would you like to hear one?"</br>"Oh god no," A\'gog says.</br>You prepare to write him off as a philistine, but decide that as a member of another species, he\'s not too likely to have a sound enough understanding of human poetry to truly appreciate it. Better that a poem go unsaid than be spoken to unappreciative ears, you figure.</br>"We\'re almost there. C\'mon." A\'gog takes your hand again and leads you down a side tunnel, bounding once more and forcing you to run.</br>You enter a great natural cavern, larger than any room you\'d thought could exist below the earth.</br>The entire space, vertically and horizontally, is laced with ropes and nets, some woven into nests like beehives, others forming intricate and beautiful patterns set against the backdrop of wondrous cave formations. And the air, the ground, even the ceiling of the place is bustling with goblins who crawl and swing and run, who dart to and fro carrying loads several times larger than themselves, who disappear down side tunnels bearing picks or who return, exhausted. Some cook, others play games on the floor, others look drunk. They tinker with devices well beyond your limited experience, and they play instruments that might be mistaken for work machines.</br>"Haddlelint, eh?" you say, taken aback, amazed, and quite a bit excited.</br>"Biggest town we got left. Kinda small, of course, but it\'s home." A\'gog ambles to a faucet set into the stone wall and washes his hands. "I\'m going to go get dinner. Might want to introduce yourself to your fans."</br>You turn from the old green man and realize that you\'re surrounded by other goblins. But it\'s not adoration you see in their eyes: it\'s curiosity and malice. Well, maybe not malice, but it\'s really hard to be certain when people have pointy yellow teeth and carry pickaxes.</br>"Qui est tu?" one of the more pugilistic of the little people demands. "Look, I don\'t speak French. It\'s dreadfully embarrassing, I know. But</br>I\'ve only been here less than a year–"</br>"Who are you?" the goblin repeats, this time in passable English.</br>"Oh, that. The name\'s Gregory. And you?" You stick out your hand, which is ignored by the goblin.</br>"We\'re preparing for war. In less than six hours, we\'re going to storm the gates of Hak\'kal, the gnomish capital, and lay waste to the city. The gnomes have enslaved us, but we will have both freedom and vengeance. Are you going to help us?"</br>',
    14: 'Your cane already raised, you attempt to land a crashing blow upon the skull of the sword-wielding woman, one that might seem heroic were it landed upon a person of your own stature. One that might have at least seemed worthwhile if it had connected at all.</br>Deft as housefly, Gu\'dal skips to the side of your blow and cuts your hamstring. You collapse, and before you have time to breathe, your lungs are punctured, your cane-hand is cut, and your eyes are destroyed.</br>It takes longer than you thought it might to die, suffocating in your own blood.</br>',
    15: '"Well I really think it\'s best to confront problems quite directly. And I suspect that I\'m quite a bit larger than one of these gnomish chaps, aren\'t I? I\'d really like to talk to one of them in person, and I suspect I can talk some sense into it."</br>"Are you that good with words?" A\'gog asks.</br>"Well, no, not really." You take off your bowler and scratch your scalp. "But I suppose I\'ve not much sense, either, so I thought I might as well try." "I would have preferred you to serve some purpose, but, well, I believe in nothing if not autonomy. Take this tunnel," A\'gog points to your right, "and take your first six lefts, then your fourth right, then the next left. You\'ll</br>walk right into the front gates. Can\'t miss them."</br>A\'gog turns and begins to walk opposite the way that you\'ve been directed.</br>You shrug, a meaningless gesture since no one is around to see it, then follow A\'gog\'s directions. An hour\'s walk—and no small amount of second-guessing your decision to confront the gnomes—later, you find yourself in an open, natural cavern. You\'re dwarfed by two gigantic, inlaid metal doors and are greeted by two creatures that look like nothing so much as half-size deep-sea divers.</br>Each of the guards bears a bizarre rifle with slowly spinning crystals along its barrel and wears a brass-and-glass helmet that disguises their face. The gnomes are twice as tall as A\'gog was—meaning they might reach your shoulder with their hands outstretched—and they\'re both, well, fearsome.</br>There\'s something frightening about things that are completely alien to your experience, particularly when those things are pointing ornate and indecipherable weapons at your head and chest.</br>"Good morrow to you," you say, remembering your manners.</br>"Va te faire foutre," one of the guards says. You don\'t remember the translation of that particular phrase remarkably well, but you\'re reasonably certain that it isn\'t a term of endearment.</br>"Wait. Sit. No movement," the other guard says, in heavily accented English.</br>You decide that decorum require that you follow these instructions, so you sit. The ruder gnome walks over to a voice-horn set into the doorway and speaks into it. Moments later, the gates open and you catch a glimpse of</br>a marvelous underground metropolis filled to overflowing with colored light and fantastical clockwork.</br>A gnome marches out the door, this one wearing a helmet that reveals his face to be rather like that of an angry, pre-pubescent boy. On top of his helmet is a quarter-life-sized statue of himself. He wears a uniform that seems to be a mockery of an aboveground military commander\'s, replete with medals, badges, and pins of all sorts—including at least one that you recognize as a campaign pin for a political candidate in aboveground France. You open your mouth to laugh at him—consider yourself rude if you will, but the fellow is quite humorous looking—but then shut it when you remember that you\'re in a cavern miles from your home and are surrounded by armed guards.</br>"This will be very simple for you. You are to be our guest, for as long or short of a time as you would like." The officer walks up to where you sit as he speaks, and he sounds gruff but not unfriendly. "But first, a test. A personality test."</br>From under his coat jacket, the officer pulls out a glass bottle of dark liquid. One of the guards rushes forward and offers a snifter, and the officer pours three fingers of what smells quite a bit like brandy into it.</br>"I will leave you with this, then go confer with my superiors. If, when I return, you have not drunk a sip of this brandy, you may join us as our guest in Hak\'kal for as long as you would like, and all of your drinking and smoking will be utterly without cost. But if you prefer, you may drink this glass now, and although you may stay for some time in our city, no one will be permitted to serve you alcohol."</br>The officer walks away, and you think about his offer. Perhaps these gnomes have a greater sense of social responsibility than the goblin had led you to believe. After all, a man who cannot abstain from drinking for a half an hour would most likely abuse a bottomless glass. But one who can hold themself back perhaps could be trusted with such a responsibility. It\'s a curious situation, you decide.</br>',
    16: '"Excellent," Yi\'ta says when you tell him your decision. "We\'ve work to set you to this very moment."</br>"Not in the morning?" you ask.</br>"Indeed not. No time for such things as sleep. No extra time whatsoever. In fact, our task will be accomplished at precisely seven-fifteen abovetime or it won\'t be accomplished at all."</br>"Why\'s that?" you ask.</br>Yi\'ta pulls an elaborate sextant from a sheath at his belt. "It has to do with the longitude we\'re at, of course, and the alignment of the sun. In order for the astral soundwaves to detonate in the correct location, considering our position and the two other contextual placements of sonaloptic–</br>"Well, suffice it to say there will not be time for sleeping. I need you to go to the secondary tower with this report," he hands you a thin, hardbound journal, "and follow any instructions that they might have for you there. I needn\'t tell you that this report must not fall into the wrong hands. If you succeed, you will be a hero to all the underfolk. Well, except to the gnomes of course."</br>You open the report and look inside. The writing—if indeed it is writing at all—looks a bit like Arabic, if Arabic were entirely straight lines at right angles to one another.</br>"How do I–" you begin to ask.</br>"Gu\'dal will show you the way." Yi\'ta turns to the back of the belfry and shouts. "Gu\'dal!"</br>A lanky goblin woman in a fancy tailcoat and black tie saunters over, her ears hidden within a tall, thin top hat, one that extends half again her height above her. She affects the use of a cane—something you are quite understanding of. When she is near, she smiles in the menacing way you now attribute to all of goblinkind.</br>"We have little time to waste, I fear," Gu\'dal says. Her voice and accent, like Yi\'ta\'s, remind you of the speaking raven you once saw at a circus performer\'s opium den.</br>Gu\'dal, whose eyes reach your knees and whose hat reaches your thigh, grabs your pale hand in her green one and leads you down the stairs and onto the lamplit streets beyond.</br>',
    17: '"They eat well, in the suburbs?" you ask.</br>"Better \'n a goblin, that\'s certain," A\'gog replies.</br>"Right then, it\'s settled. To Underburg. I know a thing or two about getting a rise out of folks who think they\'re all proper and happy."</br>"Do you always think with your stomach?" There seems to be genuine appreciation in A\'gog\'s voice.</br>"Oh no," you say. "Before I\'ve had anything to drink, I think with my… whatever the organ is that makes you want booze."</br>"Brain."</br>"Right then, before I\'m drunk, I think with my brain."</br>A\'gog giggles and bounces up and down in the tunnel, his long green ears a\'flapping. And it occurs to you that you haven\'t been thinking with your stomach or your brain. It takes you a moment, but you decide you\'ve been thinking with your heart. But that sounds terribly cliché, and certainly won\'t make it into your poetry come the morning. Instead, you decide, you have been thinking with your wormwood.</br>A\'gog takes your hand and breaks into a sprint, moving significantly faster than you would expect a green little monster who can barely meet eyes with your kneecaps to go, and you are forced into a swift jog to keep pace.</br>You fly down tunnels for twenty minutes and stop in front of a vent that A\'gog immediately begins to disassemble.</br>"So what\'s your plan? Give a good rousing speech? You Brits are good for speeches, is what I hear. I can interpret, too."</br>"No," you say. "Speeches are good for riling up people with nothing to lose, people who maybe were thinking about giving it a go but just never really made up their minds."</br>"What then?"</br>"We\'re going to destroy their way of life," you say. In the dimly-lit hallway, you don\'t know if A\'gog can see your manic grin. You\'ve never had much love for the middle class. At least the upper class knows how to party. The middle class? Worse than useless.</br>"Huh," A\'gog says. The vent comes off the wall, revealing a crawlspace. Well, a walk-space for A\'gog. A crawlspace for you. "How you going to do that?"</br>"I don\'t know yet. What\'s the situation like in Underburg?"</br>You get on hands and knees and crawl into the wind. It\'s quite painstaking and—after the first bend in the tunnel—dark. A\'gog leads the way, and you follow his voice while he apprises you.</br>"It\'s pitch black, it is. Like I was saying before, the kabouters don\'t see with their eyes, they see with their ears. They screech—it\'s a bit unnerving, just to warn you—and know where everything is."</br>"Blind as a bat?" you suggest.</br>"Bats can see with their eyes. No, they\'re blind as a cave critter. Only without the weird feeler-thingies. But kinda ugly like one, too. Anyhow, Underburg… the gnomes don\'t bother to guard Underburg. The stupid kabouters have been slaves so long they don\'t know they\'re slaves."</br>"Yup, sounds like the middle class to me. What are their houses made of?"</br>"Snot. They excrete a kind of sticky paste through their noses. It\'s good glue, but if you have enough time and enough kabouters, you can build yourself a hive."</br>"Huh. Is it flammable?" "Sure."</br>"You\'ve a lighter?" you ask.</br>"Of course. Why, you\'ve some opium?" "No, no. I just think I have a plan." "Good, we\'re nearly there."</br>',
    18: '"I never been one to speak amiably with tyrants, nor one to costume my emotions. I\'m also dreadfully afraid of missing anything interesting. So I suppose I shall volunteer myself, an infantryman in the ranks of goblins?"</br>Yi\'ta looks you up and down, no doubt gauging your suitability for the task you\'ve chosen to undertake. "Are you drunk?" he asks.</br>"Most likely," you say.</br>"Are you this brave when you\'re sober?" he asks. "I\'m afraid not."</br>"Well then, please ascertain you have enough alcohol to keep yourself intoxicated until after our glorious victory, yes?"</br>"I wouldn\'t dream of venturing out without ample spirits," you say. Inside your head, you\'re beginning to laugh. What an excellent adventure this shall be!</br>A tall—well, tall for a goblin—goblin woman approaches you, grinning quite mischievously. Although, you realize, it\'s possible that she could be grinning without the slightest trace of mischief. That\'s the thing about anthropomorphizing other creatures—it doesn\'t work.</br>"Gu\'dal," the new goblin says, thrusting her hand out at you.</br>"Gregory," you say, and shake. Your hand quite engulfs hers, and she digs her nails into your palm, perhaps by accident.</br>Gu\'dal is wearing a patchwork tailcoat over tight leather pants that show her legs to be as thin as lines. She bears a cane, its head carved into the likeness of some sort of swine-faced demon, and wears a comical stovetop hat that makes her somehow seem even thinner.</br>"You\'ll come down below with us then, storm the gates as part of the greatest horde these caverns have ever seen?"</br>"Er… yes." You avoid letting yourself reconsider. You meant it when you said that you weep for lost opportunity. How could you not volunteer to fight in an army of goblins? Besides, odds are good that you\'re merely hallucinating. It wouldn\'t be the first time.</br>Gu\'dal leads you out of the belfry and down the stairs. Whatever that bundle at the base of the tower had been, it is gone now. But there is a goblin-sized archway mysteriously set into the base of the stairs. Your guide takes your hand in hers—this time without clawing you—and you crouch to follow her through the door and into the darkness.</br>Fortunately, after a few steps, you\'ve room enough to walk upright down the stairs. And, what\'s more, your eyes begin to adjust to the dark. Up ahead, you see the faint glow of gaslight.</br>At the base of the steps, you find yourself in what looks to be a service tunnel, pipes of all diameters running along the ceiling and walls. Every few dozen yards is a dim gaslight, and spaced further apart than that are vents that spill fresh—well fresher—air into the tunnel.</br>You\'re led along this tunnel at a remarkable speed—despite her short legs, Gu\'dal walks as fast as yourself—and find yourself heading deeper and deeper underground.</br>You come into a great chamber, the breadth and height of an opera house. There are nets strung chaotically throughout the chamber, balconies and hammocks set randomly throughout. And sitting, standing, hanging, clambering, and snoring within are hundreds—dare you guess thousands?— of goblins, all dressed in makeshift spiky armor, all wielding a fantastical array of edged, blunt, and projectile weapons. And nearly all of them look like they are having a great deal of fun.</br><img src="images/18.png" alt=""></br>"You\'re preparing for war?" you ask Gu\'dal. "Of course," she replies.</br>"I had expected something more, somber, I suppose."</br>Gu\'dal doesn\'t answer you.</br>Right by the entrance, you see three gray-haired goblins sitting on their helmets, shuffling clay tiles about in front of them. It\'s quite clear that they are playing a drinking game.</br>You decide that you like the goblins.</br>"Well, if all goes as we hope, we should be underway within the next few hours. Do you want to be right up in front, make sure you catch all the action?" Gu\'dal looks enchanted, enthralled, at the prospect of going to war against the gnomes.</br>',
    19: '"What is that we\'re carrying, anyhow?" you ask.</br>"I don\'t understand all of it," Gu\'dal says. "But basically, we\'re building amplifiers and receivers in the belltowers. We\'ll toll them in certain sequences—those sequences are recorded in the notebook—and if everything is lined up correctly, blam-o."</br>"Blam-o?"</br>"We strike down the gates to Hak\'kal and flow through like stormwater, washing their sins away with blood." Gu\'dal gets a bit of spring in her step as she describes the glorious revolution, flashing her fangs, and you can\'t help but wonder if you\'re on the right side.</br>"But what is Hak\'kal?"</br>"Hak\'kal is a monster. We goblins used to have a holy cave filled with food and riches. It was never depleted, because we were careful; we didn\'t live in the cave, we just went there to gather. Then the gnomes came and built a city in our holy cave. Within ten years they\'d exhausted their resources and now we goblins are forced to mine their metals. The slaves they brought with them, the kabouters, they gather all their food. The gnomes live like happy little kings and we goblins are their slaves. Until tomorrow. Then we\'ll–</br>"Watch out!" Gu\'dal says, pulling you into an alley.</br>"What?" you whisper, your back against the darkened brick, but Gu\'dal puts her hand over her mouth, signaling you into silence.</br>As you watch from the darkness, three police officers stroll by on their rounds, swinging truncheons at their sides. You\'re about to step out of the alley—skulking usually drawing more attention than simply walking— when you see what appears to be a child scurry after them.</br>"That\'s a gnome," Gu\'dal whispers in your ear. You turn around and see that your friend is suddenly at your eye level: Gu\'dal is clinging to the brick with claws on her hands and feet.</br>You stare after the retreating gnome. If it weren\'t for the friendly green monster hiding in the alley next to you, you would never believe that the child-like silhouette was anything other than just that—a child.</br>The gendarmes past, you slip out of the alley and continue another three blocks to the secondary tower.</br>',
    20: '"Of course! I\'d hate to miss any of the fun," you say. You\'re not sure why you say it. But say it you do.</br>Gu\'dal smiles at you, quite charming in her skeletal, green, pointy- toothed-and-black-gummed kind of way. It seems like everyone you know on the surface has a carefully practiced dispassion, a lack of interest in anything that matters to the real world. (Excepting your brother, of course, who was exiled for sedition.) But down here, people seem to care about something.</br>You make your way up to the front of the room, carefully stepping over sleeping goblins, narrowly avoiding being caught in the middle of a lively game of "catch the axe-head."</br>When you reach the front of the crowd, up near a large set of steel doors that you presume to lead towards Hak\'kal, you find a cut-off stalagmite to sit upon and, before you know it, fall asleep.</br>Ten seconds or three hours later, you\'re roused by a booming, high- pitched voice. Dangling by a rope from the ceiling, a large goblin woman hangs in plate armor that looks cobbled from cookware. You realize that she\'s giving a speech.</br>Gu\'dal translates parts of it for you: "‘Goblins of the mines, goblins of the fields. Our parents\' parents\' parents\' parents\' parents\' parents\'—sorry, there\'s a simpler word for it in Goblin—‘lived here in these tunnels. They lived honestly. They worked when it pleased them, invented only what was worth inventing. They built and ventilated these tunnels. They ate the mushrooms right off the walls! They sang and they danced. Sometimes they fought one another, sure. Sometimes they stole children from the humans above. But it is not as the gnomes will say, is it?\'"</br>The entire crowd roared, "Hin!" You presume this to be the word for "no."</br>"‘Every generation, we have tried to cast off our chains. Every generation, we have tried to destroy Hak\'kal, only to fail! Will it be any different this time?"</br>As one voice, the crowd screams "Hin!" You begin to doubt your ability to guess what words mean.</br>"‘We will fight and we will die! We will fight and we will die!\'" Gu\'dal whispers this last bit of translation to you, then joins in the chant. "Gad</br>urrthrane gad urrthrus! Gad urrthrane gad urrthrus!"</br>You pull a flask of brandy from its place in your vest pocket and drain it in one, long pull. Unfortunately, you\'re still not feeling precisely "in the moment," so you take your hipflask from its place tucked into your belt and begin to sip the grain alcohol within. Eventually, your mind goes where you want it to go. "Gad urrhtrane gad urrthrus! Gad urrthrane gad urrthrus!" you chant. And suicidal a chant it might be, it gets to you. You\'re ready. Ready to fight, ready to die.</br>',
    21: '"These gnomish chaps," you ask, "are they as short as you all?"</br>"Oh no," the goblin says, "each one is twice as tall as a goblin and weighs easily up to four stone!"</br>"I\'ll be happy to help," you say, because you weigh ten stone and if there\'s a fight you can win, it\'s one against a foe half your height and stature.</br>"Hurrah!" a goblin—a different one—lets out. And suddenly a dozen small hands are upon you, dragging you along to join the rest of the horde. As one, you march out of the town, through a long tunnel, and into a tall room that looks almost like an opera hall: a tall cylinder with a floor that is sloped down towards… well, instead of a stage there is a massive set of steel doors.</br>And instead of an audience, there are hundreds, maybe even thousands, of goblins dressed for war. But if you\'d hoped for a somber war party, you have come to the wrong cavern. Well, you are rarely hoping for a somber party of any sort, so you\'re most likely quite delighted: the goblins prance and play and drink—and copulate, it seems, if those two suspended in a net fifteen feet above your head are doing what you think they are doing—all while dressed in a crazy assortment of mismatched armor and wielding any number of misappropriated tools.</br>A\'gog steps up and finds you, leads you to the front of the crowd. "Wouldn\'t want to miss anything, I wouldn\'t, and my eyesight isn\'t what it once was."</br>Looking at the crowd around you, you suddenly feel quite underdressed. Certainly, you\'d look impeccable—well, a bit dusty—at a soirée, but you haven\'t a stitch of armor about you, and while your cane is quite handy for threatening the children of beggars, you wouldn\'t expect it to handle a full- fledged war.</br>It\'s when you remember the existence of guns that your blood turns to ice. You\'re four times as tall as any other target.</br>"Tell me," you ask A\'gog, "do the gnomes have guns?"</br>"No, no, of course not. A gun would be too dangerous underground. What if they struck a pipe? The pressure would blow the whole tunnel, it would."</br>Somehow, this relieves you a little bit. But your guide continues:</br>"No, they don\'t use guns. They use lightrifles."</br>You decide you don\'t want to know what a lightrifle is. Ignorance may not be bliss, but you don\'t see any good place to relieve yourself and therefore "frightful sounding" sounds better than "the certainty of doom" that you\'re afraid you might come to understand.</br>Your fretting is interrupted by the dramatic descent from the ceiling—via rope—of a rather large goblin woman wearing armor that is clearly piecemeal assembled from cookware. She speaks in a loud, clear, high- pitched voice, and stirs great emotion in the room. It\'s a shame you can\'t understand what she\'s saying.</br>"What\'s she saying," you ask A\'gog. Nearby, someone shushes you.</br>"Eh, you know. The same old crap. We goblins are great, the gnomes killed everything good. We have to fight. We won\'t win… you know, a battle speech."</br>"We won\'t win?" you ask, because you feel quite invested in a victorious outcome for the side that you have chosen nearly at random.</br>You are shushed again, and A\'gog doesn\'t translate anything more.</br>The crowd gets driven to a fervor, many of them weeping red tears, many of them screaming, chanting, banging their weapons against their armor. Then…</br>Then the chanting stops, and the great doors in front of you stay closed.</br>Someone makes an announcement.</br>A\'gog then addresses the room. In English, probably for your sake. "I don\'t care. So Yi\'ta messed up. Yi\'ta always messes up. I don\'t know about any of you, but I\'m going to fight, because I\'m an old man and I probably won\'t even be around next chance we get. If I\'m gonna die, I want to die drunk at the hands of our foes! And I\'m going to bring this poor, moronic Englishman with me!"</br>You pull a small flask from your hatband and empty it.</br>Everyone starts to shuffle out of the room, back towards the goblin town. The battle is over, it seems, before it has begun. Even the woman with her battle-speech departs, leaving you alone in the chamber with A\'gog.</br>"Well, how about it?" he asks.</br>',
    22: '"We make it, you know," Gu\'dal says, stopping to run her fingers along a set of small whistles set into one pipe. "The gnomes design it, but it\'s not like we couldn\'t do that ourselves. This one sounds an alarm if the pressure has built up too high. It has notes for the gnomes, and higher pitched tones that only us goblins can hear."</br>Your guide takes her hands off of the pipes and turns to look at you. "The gnomes will tell you, when you talk to them, that they\'ve civilized us. That we do this work and that we are appreciative of it. That they taught us the wonders of technology. It\'s not true. One hundred and seventy years ago, when Hak\'kal was built, we goblins already knew about light and sound. All they brought was steam. Steam, and, of course, slavery."</br>You walk awhile longer while you consider what she said. It\'s a strange, dark place, this underground. You begin to hope, for what will not be the last time, that you\'re indeed hallucinating this whole experience.</br>"We\'re here," Gu\'dal says. "The gates to Hak\'kal are just around the corner."</br>',
    23: '"Tell me a bit about yourself," you say to Gu\'dal. "What?" She looks genuinely concerned. "Why?"</br>"I\'m curious, you know. I\'ve never met a goblin before."</br>"Well I\'ve never met a human either, but I\'m not going to go sticking my ears into your business."</br>"You\'ve never met a human? Really?" You walk down the deserted cobblestone street, a bit of fog rising from sewer grates.</br>"No, of course not. In the resistance, it\'s just diplomats who work aboveground. This is the first time any of those engineers or us warriors have ever seen the sky, tell you the truth."</br>You look up into the dark heavens above you, catching what stars you can past the streetlamp\'s glow. You think about what it would be like to have never had an expanse above you, and you shudder. "You\'re a warrior, then?" you ask, looking up at Orion.</br>"Been studying since my head reached only to your shins. In between work shifts, we drill. It\'s the best thing in life, training. We don\'t make it look like training, of course. The gnomes think we\'re just dancing."</br>"How could someone mistake militia training for dancing?"</br>"Never underestimate the civilized\'s contempt for the tribal. We sing, do things in rhythm, and they think it\'s art. In fact, I\'ll tell you a story. My uncle, see, he was a bomb maker. He did demolitions for mining, mostly, of course, but he studied how to take down the doors to Hak\'kal. He even built a machine for it, the craziest contraption you\'ll ever see, with pneumatics and a drilling arm and optical systems to correctly orient itself. Thing was, three days before he was going to put into place, only hours before he was going to fill it up with gunpowder, the gnomes did a sweep through our camp. They saw his machine and they asked him what it was. ‘Art\', he said, and the damn thing is in a museum in Hak\'kal. I saw once when I was–</br>"Watch out!" Gu\'dal yells, dragging you into a nearby alley.</br>"What?" you whisper. But Gu\'dal puts her hand over her mouth. Three police officers walk past, swinging truncheons, one whistling a lively folk tune. You press your back further to the wall, not wanting to be seen skulking about in alleys, and you see what looks like a child hurrying along behind them.</br>"That\'s a gnome," Gu\'dal whispers from her newfound perch atop a trash can.</br>"How do you know?" you whisper back.</br>Just then the child-or-gnome barks an order at the gendarmes, one that you don\'t understand, and the police obey, turning into the alley across the street from you. No child would be ordering the police about, of course. And with a friendly green monster standing beside you in the shadows, you\'re willing to believe a lot more than usual.</br>Gu\'dal grabs your hand and you find your way through the alley as quickly and silently as you can. You make it to the next street and reach the first tower on your rounds.</br>',
    24: 'A\'gog passes you his lighter and you strike it, witnessing a bizarre scene. A hatch in the floor opens onto a rope ladder and darkness. A green little man—A\'gog—stands poised to descend, and right behind him stands perhaps the strangest looking creature you\'ve ever seen. He\'s taller than the goblin and shorter than you, but it\'s hard to discern his height in the dim light and the strange cramped corridor. His skin is paler than that of a sickly white fellow; his eyes are enormous unseeing orbs. His ears are deranged, maybe like an elephant\'s. And he\'s hyperventilating, you think. Only, you know, silently.</br>"Hello?" you ask.</br>"Good morrow. Are you here with the Aboveground?" The stranger speaks with excellent English, although you detect a hint of a Russian accent.</br>"Yes," you say, thinking that he means the surface of the earth. "Hell no," A\'gog corrects.</br>"What?" the kabouter—what else could he be?—asks. "We\'re not with those wimpy city gnomes."</br>"Oh," you say. "Is that like, how, up above, we have, you know, the Underground?"</br>"Is that the resistance movement that is largely incompetent and people mostly just join so that they can be impressed with themselves and have sex?"</br>"Well," you think. "I\'ve never heard it put that way before, but… yes." "Then yes. The Aboveground is like your Underground. Only the</br>Underground is aboveground, and the Aboveground is underground, of course."</br>"Of course," you say. This calls for a drink, and the flask in your boot happily obliges. You pass it to your two companions, who both drink deeply.</br>"So you\'re not with the Aboveground. Are you working with the gnomes?"</br>"I\'ll have your ears, you snotty bastard!" A\'gog reaches to grab the stranger.</br>You try to hold him back, but no sooner is your hand on his shoulder than you get kicked something vicious in the chest.</br>"Sorry, sorry," the kabouter says. "I offer you a sincere apology, my good goblin. Believe me, I would not have thought you to be a–"</br>"You\'d better not have," A\'gog grumps.</br>"Look, I\'m quite confused," you say, "so I\'ll just lay it all out. My  handsome, forgiving, and very-much-not-a-traitor friend A\'gog and I were on our way to Underburg to see what kind of trouble we could stir up, see if we couldn\'t recruit some of you capable folks for a full-scale revolution."</br>"And how did you think to do that?"</br>',
    25: 'The brandy is incredibly strong, incredibly tasty. It also appears to be drugged.</br>When you wake, you\'re in an opium den, surrounded by fellow humans. Between the haze of drugs and the endless decanters of brandy, though, you never do make sense of your situation.</br>Perhaps this is the peak of your life: you\'ve found the bar that there is no need to stumble home from, the opium den never raided by police. You rouse and slumber at random intervals, and never again learn to distinguish dream-state from reality.</br>In a rare moment of lucidity, you decide that you don\'t care.</br>Eventually, the drugs seep so deeply into your brain that you fail to notice the distinction between living and death. You die, most likely, perhaps years or decades or hours after arriving in Hak\'kal, in a city- sponsored prison for those prone to excess. You don\'t remember exactly how to distinguish pleasure from sorrow, but you have the distinct impression that you die quite happy.</br>',
    26: '"Oh heavens no," you say. "I don\'t see myself as much of a combatant, not really."</br>"Coward, are you?" asks the one who menaces you currently.</br>"Why, no!" you say, then think of a bigger lie to disguise that smaller one. "It\'s just that, well, I don\'t believe in it. I don\'t believe in war."</br>"Well I don\'t believe in grash\'nar," the goblin says, the word foreign and guttural and honestly quite frightening, "but that didn\'t keep one from eating my older brother!"</br>The rest of the goblins laugh at this macabre humor, but it merely emboldens your stance.</br>"Now see here, you can\'t just go around enacting vengeance all of the time. It\'s no way to solve the problem of violence. You can\'t solve anger with a sword any more than you can cure sobriety with abstinence!"</br>"Your brain is made out of those little flecked mushrooms, the ones that look like the penis of a rat." With this bizarre insult, the angry goblin walks away. The rest of the crowd soon follows suit, and you\'re left standing quite confused in the midst of a great deal of hubbub. Most of the town\'s goblins appear to be assembling a good bit distant from you, many of them wearing makeshift armor and wielding nasty looking engineering and mining tools.</br>Two goblins approach you, holding hands and dressed quite unlike the rest of their fellows. Where most of the goblins in your sight are wearing rag-tag suits, engineering clothes, or battle raiment, these wear thick woolen tunics embroidered with the symbols of the arcane that you recognize from the alchemist phase that you went through in your youth.</br>"We heard your words, friend, and believe you," the shorter of the two goblins says.</br>"You do? Why?" you ask, unable to catch yourself.</br>"Because we have uttered them ourselves, though we too were met with scorn. What our brethren fail to understand is that the problems we goblins face are internal. We must defeat the colonization of our brains, the colonization of prejudice and resentment, before we can begin  to understand the problem outside of us. Don\'t you agree?"</br>"Sure," you say, a bit uncertain as to what you are agreeing with.</br>"You must join us!" says the second goblin, the taller one. "We have battles to fight, yes, but they are battles of perception and understanding,</br>not retribution. Our weapons are our vapors, our armor is our mind."</br>',
    27: '"Well, you see," you begin, your mind searching around for a suitable excuse. "I\'m quite tall, you understand. An easy target. But also, quite useful tactically. I can survey the situation more effectively if I\'m at a more appreciable distance…"</br>While you\'re talking, Gu\'dal looks at you with a face that may or may not be condemnation, then walks to the front of the room, leaving you behind.</br>"Yes, well…" you begin, talking to yourself.</br>"Makes sense to me," a young-looking goblin man says, from his position hanging in a net very close to right above your head.</br>"It does?" you ask.</br>"Certainly. And why, I bet you\'d make a first-class goblin-thrower, too, when the front lines thin out and we need reinforcements."</br>"Of course," you say. "Naturally."</br>You find a spot to lean against the wall near the back of the room, and soon fall asleep.</br>Just as you being to have a pleasant dream about a seductive haberdasher, you\'re woken by someone giving a speech. High above the crowd, dangling from a rope, a powerful-looking goblin woman armored with cast-iron pots and pans addresses the room in a shrill but charismatic voice.</br>Unfortunately, you\'ve no clue what she\'s saying. The crowd responds a few times, gathering energy, then begins to chant. It sounds like "God earth rain, god earth rush" to you, so that\'s what you chant, in between sips of whisky from the flask in your boot.</br>"God earth rain, god earth rush! God earth rain, god earth rush!"</br>It gets your blood going, even if it\'s gibberish. You\'re ready to fight. Gu\'dal emerges from the front of the room and looks at you appraisingly,</br>but you keep chanting. The alcohol and the power of the crowd have gotten to you. Gu\'dal smiles her disconcerting smile.</br>',
    28: 'Your willpower overcomes your oft-drunken mind and you hold the glass in your hands for a half-hour before the captain returns. Upon seeing the brandy remaining in the snifter, a look of alarm crosses his face and he blows a whistle.</br>Seven heavily-armed riflegnomes double-step march through the gates and arrest you bodily, bludgeoning you into unconsciousness.</br>When you awaken, you find yourself high above the city, perched naked in a human-sized birdcage hanging by a chain from a stalactite. On the floor of the cage is a small bowl filled with something that smells like oatmeal. Next to it is a sign, written in sixteen different languages. In English, it says: "Sing, and you eat. The louder and more beautifully you sing, the better you eat."</br>Across the ceiling of the vast cavern you see other birdcages, filled with naked humans of all ages. The cage closest to you holds a man even younger than yourself, one who seems to be signaling to you by holding his arms out at angles.</br>It takes you hours to decipher the semaphore code he\'s using, but eventually you learn enough to communicate.</br>"Don\'t speak aloud, or they\'ll hurt us," he says.</br>"Alright," you respond, laboring over each letter of the code.</br>"You refrained from drinking the brandy, didn\'t you? Bad idea. Means you\'re smart enough that you might have caused trouble."</br>Shortly after this communication, the man in the cage near you is taken roughly away by gnomes on an impossibly tall ladder. He never returns.</br>When it comes your turn to sing, you sing. For years and years, you sing.</br>Until the end of your life, you sing in your birdcage above the city.</br>',
    29: 'A\'gog opens a hatch in the floor, though you can\'t see anything, and passes you his lighter.</br>You strike the flint, the wick catches, and you find yourself staring into the huge, unseeing eyes of a bizarre thing—not to be rude, but you certainly have a hard time finding another word to describe the creature. You jump with a start, smacking your head on the ceiling, and it takes off at a run down the crawlspace.</br>"Was that a, uh…"</br>"Kabouter? Yes. And he noticed us, as you might have guessed.</br>Whatever it is we\'re going to do, we\'d better do it quickly."</br>You look through the hatch, and see a metal-runged rope ladder dangling down into the darkness. You put your foot on the first rung, shrug, douse your flame, and descend.</br>Three hundred rungs—well, give or take a score, your fear of heights distracting your count for a good moment—later, you put your foot onto solid stone ground and re-strike your flame.</br>Hive was indeed an apt word. You\'re in the midst of a strange nightmare, shrunk down and thrust into the hive of a bee. Everything glistens and looks oozy. There\'s no separation between buildings here; they all melt together. It\'s like you\'re in the belly of a terrible, terrible monster. And the monster smells bad.</br>You rush up to the nearest wall of snot and bring your flame to it. It takes only a moment before it catches, and A\'gog screams, right behind you.</br>"I could kill you!" he says to you. "But I won\'t have to." "What?"</br>The flames spread quickly, and you have to step back away from the heat. Soon the entire cavern seems to be burning. Including your rope ladder.</br>"Don\'t worry," you say, "the flames are dying as fast as they started." "That\'s because they\'ve used up all the oxygen," A\'gog tells you. "Exactly! See? Since we\'re in a cave, the fire can\'t last long enough to…</br>oh."</br>And those are your last mortal words, because it turns out that you, like fire, require oxygen to breathe. You fall to the floor and suffocate, your skin scorched. An angry, angry old goblin dies beside you.</br>',
    30: 'You walk down the hallway in a silence punctuated only by the echoes of your footsteps and by Gu\'dal\'s loud breathing. Eventually, Gu\'dal stops."The gates to Hak\'kal are just around the corner," she says. "I\'m not getting close. Good luck. And if you tell them about what we\'re doing up above, in your clock tower, I\'ll kill you in your sleep."',
    31: 'Gu\'dal tells you where you\'re going and you set out, reasonably sure of your direction. You\'ve only been in the city for about a year, but the two towers aren\'t far out of the area you know well.</br>The moon peeks through clouds above you, shining gibbous and pale. A few stars are out, calming you. What a horror it would be to live underground, you think, to spend your days without the heavens above.</br>Your mind wanders as the two of you walk in silence down the empty boulevards of your adopted home. You think about England, a land that is likely to be forever behind you, a land you honestly don\'t miss. And you think about your elder brother, whose footsteps you followed by moving to France. Then you think of him, deported to French Guinea, doomed to spend the rest of his life in the prison colony, and your mood turns sour. Perhaps there is something to this talk of revolution, you decide.</br>But your thoughts are soon interrupted.</br>"Police!" Gu\'dal calls out, dragging you into the shadows of a nearby alley. As soon as you are off the street, she upturns a trash can and holds it up to you. "Put it on! Hurry!"</br>Before you have time to question to the sanity or hygienety of such an action, you obey. It\'s a tight fit, but you\'re able to sit on the ground, completely covered. Soon you hear several sets of boot steps approach. A high-pitched voice calls out in a language you don\'t understand and the police—as you assume them to be—begin to search the alley. You hold  your breath as they come within inches of discovering you. And while you\'ve committed no crime, being discovered under a trash can in an alley at this hour—with a goblin for a companion no less—would certainly be uncomfortable.</br>But the gendarmes don\'t find you, and a few minutes after their footsteps recede you uncover yourself and stand.</br>By some miracle, you smell no worse than you did when you started, and in no time at all you find yourself at the door to the first clock tower on your list.</br>',
    32: '"Hak\'kal?" The city\'s name is guttural, like the sound of someone about to spit, or like something the Dutch would say. "It\'s the gnome\'s cultural center, to hear them tell of it. It\'s an impressive place; all kinds of towers spiring from the floor like stalagmites, and there\'s a huge university where no goblin may study. It\'s a city, a bit like the ones you\'ve got up there. You\'ve got to talk to \'em, you\'ve got to tell them to let us goblins free. We can\'t work like this forever. Every generation is getting more and more used to slavery. It\'s just not right. Please." Gu\'dal looks up at you, perhaps on the verge of tears.</br>"Alright," you say, "I\'ll do what I can. I\'ll try to talk the gnomes into letting you go." As soon as you say it aloud, you realize that you mean it. Sure, the goblins are strange and feisty and dangerous. But so are most of your friends. It won\'t do to have them stay enslaved.</br>"Well," Gu\'dal says, "the gates to Hak\'kal are just around the next corner. When I tell you good luck, I mean it. They\'re a deceitful bunch. I\'ve no doubt they\'ll try to win you over to their side. We goblins have a saying, ‘You can tell a goblin doesn\'t like you when they\'ve stuck a knife in you. You can tell a gnome doesn\'t like you when they\'re offering you wine.\'"</br>Gu\'dal thinks for a moment, then continues. "Actually, that\'s kind of a racist saying. There are some good gnomes. It\'s just that good gnomes tend to wind up dead, at least in Hak\'kal."</br>',
    33: 'The first clock tower on your list is squat and old, the stonework tarnished the color of smog, the clock face a mere ten meters above the cobbles. The door at the base is of iron-banded oak, and a padlock of thick steel holds it shut.</br>Before you\'ve the chance to despair, Gu\'dal removes a set of lock picks from a place of concealment in her hat and begins to work at the lock with the manual dexterity and finesse you\'ve seen exhibited only by thieves, contraptors, and clowns. (Although most of those you\'ve met in one of those categories might easily be lumped into the other two as well!)</br>While you keep watch in the pre-dawn fog, Gu\'dal sets the wards into place, and the door opens before panic has a chance to overcome your slightly addled mind. You slip into the darkness beyond and find your way up the circular staircase until you reach the dimly-lit belfry.</br>The scene inside is similar to the one you have so recently left: workgoblins of all manner and of every shade of green are working at a ponderous speed to contrapt some device. But what stands out to you, aside from a certain solemnity, is the human gentleman of very advanced years who appears to be guiding them.</br>It is this man who approaches you—or rather, approaches Gu\'dal. He hobbles over, making heavy use of his cane, and begins to converse with Gu\'dal in a not-unpleasant tongue.</br>"Pardon me, sir," you interject, as the fellow looks remarkably English.</br>The man looks at you, his face contorted to mimic the look of a frightened dog that had been recently jabbed with the point of a cane.</br>Gu\'dal, in turn, looks at you in obvious annoyance and pulls you aside for a moment\'s conference. "Mr. Babbage was a prisoner in Hak\'kal for a decade before we effected his release. His taskmaster was an Englishman. I would leave the conversation to me."</br>Thusly chastised, you stand a bit away for the rest of the brief encounter. You see a wild animal buried under the gentleman\'s eyes, but Gu\'dal manages her business and shortly you are out the door towards the next clock tower.</br>Half done, you are thinking, and not a bad bit of work. "The hero of goblinkind," they said, and you\'ve never heard of a hero who pays for his  or her own drinks.</br>But as your footsteps lighten at the prospect of goblin-financed hedonism, a patrol of policemen stop your path.</br>"Arrêter-vous!" they say.</br>You look up frightened, and what you presume to be a gnome steps out between the legs of two cops. "You\'ve been tricked, human, and we\'ve been tailing you. The goblin you escort is a wanted revolutionist, a terrorist. If she and her friends would have their way, this city and mine would fall into ruin and anarchy. Whatever she may have told you, she can\'t be trusted."</br>',
    34: '"No thank you," you say, "I think my place is here." You pointedly avoid mention of how obviously garish their clothes are or how clearly backwards they are for believing the gibberish you\'ve been spouting.</br>The pair shrugs in unison and walk away. "You fighting or not, British man?"</br>You turn around to find A\'gog hopping up and down, his cane pressed into the cave floor, his long ears flapping so that he looks curiously like a green, talking rabbit tied to a stick. In fact, the image is so strange that you begin to giggle—quite rudely—at the sight.</br>A\'gog bounces away, and the horde leaves the cavern. Somewhere, a great creak and moan of machinery shudders in the walls and you are left in total darkness, quite alone, not even a sound to keep you company.</br>You sit down on the warm stone floor, remove a flask from your vest pocket, and sip. Three long sips later, it\'s drained, and you lie down—quite logically, you feel—to sleep.</br>You do not even dream. And when you\'re roused by a pale, rude child wearing a diver\'s helmet and wielding a frighteningly complex rifle, you decide to take your lack of dreams as evidence that you are, indeed, dreaming this whole mad adventure. Thusly, you ignore the child.</br>Until he jabs you in the neck with the barrel of his gun. "Bugger off," you say.</br>"Get up."</br>"I don\'t feel like it," you tell him, and pull your bowler down over your eyes, resuming a supine position.</br>"I will kill you, human."</br>"You\'re a human too," you say, growing ever more irritable. What\'s more, your head is pounding and your throat is quite dry.</br>"Get up!" The gnome bellows this in a voice deeper than any child\'s, deeper than any grown man\'s. It seems to shake the whole cavern, and for a moment you fear a cave-in. Then, when you realize you\'re almost never this hung over in dreams, you fear the rifle pointed into your throat.</br>"I\'m sorry," you say, rising to a sitting position, "I had thought I was dreaming."</br>"You\'re not."</br>"I suppose you\'re a gnome, then?"</br>The child—correct that, gnome—in a diver\'s helmet nods. "Well your whole war is foolishness. It\'s simply nonsensical."</br>"How is that?" the gnome asks, forcing you at gunpoint to stand and begin to leave the cavern.</br>More gnomes—in their absurd helmets—join you as you are marched down the hallway and you launch into your oratory. It is perhaps the finest speech of your life, using logical and emotional appeals that would bring tears to the eyes of even the most evil of humans. You begin at the source of all conflict—the lack of compassion and cooperation that is a plague upon sentience—and work your way to the specifics—or what you can muster, which is very little—of the present conflict between gnomes and goblins.</br>The guards laugh, and soon one runs off and returns with a second band, so they too can hear you and be amused.</br>They speak amongst themselves in a language you can\'t understand, and you\'re led into an underground zoo, a terrible menagerie full of creatures that, like you, can only suffer if denied sunlight.</br>A cage is opened, and you\'re thrown in. The only other occupant is a pile of bones and the dry-rotted garb of a mime.</br>In addition to the mighty lion, the fearsome golden eagle, and the ponderous sloth, there are cages holding creatures you\'ve never set eyes upon, many of which walk upright and wear clothing. But none speak to you.</br>You scour your cage for a way out, to no avail. You scream, just once, a catharsis that rattles the cages and wakes all the creatures sleeping in the place, and then you sit down, once again, to drink yourself into a stupor.</br>At some point, a guard comes and makes your position clear. You are to be displayed as a pacifist, the most rare and least capable of nature\'s creatures. You will be well fed, cared for, and drugged at your wish. But only as long as you continue to orate.</br>It\'s up to you, dear reader, how you spend the rest of your time in that terrible cage, a league beneath the surface of the earth. Will you play their jester and amuse them, eating fine steaks and drinking absinthe? Or will you starve yourself out of pride? Will you go mad? Madder than you are? Or will you adapt, somehow, and attempt to make company with the few gnomes who visit the dusty, cruel cave that holds you?</br>No matter what you choose, you have reached</br>',
    35: '"So, do you actually have a plan? Or are you just going to charge at the city gates, me swinging my cane?" you ask.</br>"I\'ve got some leverage I\'ve been thinking about," he responds. "Good enough for me," you say. "Brandy?"</br>You pull a flask from your boot and the two of you make short work of it. Your vision adequately blurred, your movements pleasantly fluid, and your brain somewhere taking a nap, the two of you pull open the steel gates and work your way through narrow service tunnels.</br>You crawl on your hands and knees, until A\'gog convinces you to stand up. It turns out that the ceiling is actually above your head, despite what your drunken mind had convinced you.</br>Eventually, you find your way to an underground menagerie, a bizarre zoo filled with sad creatures.</br>"Here\'s the plan," A\'gog explains. "We set the lion loose, and wait for someone to come by. Then, while they\'re busy fighting the lion, we steal their keys or take them hostage or do something else that seems clever like make a gnome-suit from their skin."</br>"Of course," you say, because there isn\'t too much else that one could say to such a proposition. "Just one question. Why won\'t the lion eat us if we set it free?"</br>"Aren\'t you British?" A\'gog asks.</br>"Well, by birth, though certainly not by allegiance."</br>"Can\'t you Brits stare lions into submission? I thought it was part of, you know, your deal."</br>"I have no idea what you\'re talking about."</br>"Well you climb up onto that one," A\'gog points at an empty cage that\'s decorated like an 18th century French bedroom, "and I\'ll just ride the lion. Lions don\'t eat goblins."</br>His logic impeccable in your altered state, you clamber up the cage after only three failed attempts. A\'gog enters the lion cage and mounts the beast as though it were a horse (or, for size comparison, an elephant). And you set about to wait.</br>It\'s not long—well, maybe it\'s long, but you\'re drunk so you don\'t really know—before a gaggle of gnomish children wander into the zoo.</br>"Now," A\'gog yells, and bursts out of the cage, barreling down on the hapless kids.</br>',
    36: '"I think what we need right now is a good rabble-rousing. A speech. That\'ll test the waters, and we\'ll find out soon enough what the kabouters are made of."</br>"We\'re made of carbon, same as a human." "It\'s a metaphor."</br>"No, a metaphor is when you say one thing is another. Like ‘kabouters muscles are mushrooms and their brains are nightmares.\'"</br>"What?"</br>"I\'m not certain. I think we are both speaking the same language, but yet we are not speaking the same language, yes?"</br>"Well, my name is Gregory," you say, and stick out your hand. "And mine is Sergei," he says.</br>Russian indeed. Quite curious.</br>"Now, Gregory, let us go into Underburg—as you no doubt have heard it called—and I will gather up everyone who will listen at the… the best word is ‘church.\' And then you will be disappointed when no one joins your glorious revolution but me and one or two of my friends."</br>You hand A\'gog the light, and begin to descend the ladder. A\'gog caps the lighter and joins you. You climb in darkness.</br>You count one hundred rungs or so before you are too distracted by the creepy, echoing shrieks that bounce throughout the darkness about you. It seems forever before your foot touches the floor. You stand and stretch to your full height, your bones creaking, your muscles sore, and you\'ve a bit  of a headache coming on. Then A\'gog\'s foot is on your head, then his whole weight, and the two of you drop to the ground.</br>"Sorry about that. Thought you was the ground." "I\'m not the ground," you say.</br>"Well I know that now."</br>"Mind striking a flame?" you ask, as you get to your feet. "I do mind, matter of fact. It\'s a bad idea."</br>"Why? I thought no one here can see? What\'ll it matter?"</br>"This whole city is pretty flammable, and the kabouters don\'t like fire." Suddenly, you hear a screech right next to your head, disorienting you.</br>You realize, of course, that it is just Sergei getting a sense of his surroundings.</br>"Follow me," the kabouter says, and grabs your elbow. You reach back and grab A\'gog by the hair, and the three of you traipse off into the invisible city. Well, it\'s not really invisible, of course. You just can\'t see it. By that standard, you\'re invisible too.</br>Sergei calls out in a language that sounds like Yankee, if Yankees spoke gibberish, and you hear at least a dozen voices respond.</br>"They\'re gathering," he says.</br>"I\'ll interpret," A\'gog says to you. "I like interpreting. Only thing I\'m good for, really."</br>You try to think of something to raise his spirits, but you really don\'t know the first thing about him except that he\'s old, he\'s a goblin, and he\'s small as hell. And that he likes alcohol.</br>"Want a sip of gin?" you ask, offering him a flask you had strapped to your shin under the cuff of your pants.</br>"Of course," he says. "Now, what are you going to talk about?" "Oh, that."</br>',
    37: '"You know, I\'ve had a really great evening, all told, and have learned quite so much, but I\'m afraid it\'s getting quite early and a gentleman must have his rest, you see."</br>A\'gog looks at you, and nods. "Coward, then. Fair enough. I suppose it\'s not your fight, now is it? I suppose you can live quite happily on the surface of the world, sunlight on your face, free from the government of your birth but not the despots of your adopted country, no reason to be bothered by the agony that we slaves suffer right beneath your feet. You wouldn\'t be the first."</br>"Quite right," you say, "I\'m so glad you understand! Now, if you could be so kind as to direct me back to my tower? I quite look forward to sleeping."</br>But rather than answer you, A\'gog pries the steel doors open a crack and disappears through.</br>You leave him to his fate and count on your sense of direction to lead you home.</br>Eight hours later, at the edge of desperation, you stumble up the stairs to your tower, trigger the secret door, and collapse on the floor of the tower\'s entryway. The door slams shut behind you, and you pass out, sober and exhausted.</br>"Wake up," you hear, and you look up to see the face of a young woman. "I had the craziest dream," you say, "and I must have sleepwalked down the steps…"</br>"I don\'t care about your dream. I have a message for you," she speaks in clear English with a French accent.</br>"A message?" you say, excited. You like messages. "Is it from some attractive person who wishes to make the acquaintance of a man of words such as I?"</br>The woman\'s boot finds your face, bloodying your nose. "Don\'t fuck with the gnomes. The gnomes will fucking kill you, and they\'ll find your brother and they\'ll kill him too."</br>The woman leaves you, stalking away, and you rise to a sitting position.</br>You don\'t like being bullied, and you don\'t like to be struck outside the bedroom.</br>You sell your possessions and buy a pistol. The goblins know where to find you, and next time you\'ll be ready to help them. With absinthe to steel your will, you\'ll take on any foe of liberty. But first, to bust your brother  out of prison in the colonies. No matter, you\'ve a friend who can help you stow away. The future will be bright, bloody, and drunk, you determine. And full of freedom.</br>',
    38: '"So you kabouters are slaves, when it comes down to it?" "Of course," the kabouter says.</br>"But they treat you well enough, most of the time."</br>"Indeed, as long as we don\'t cause too much trouble, we don\'t even really know we\'re slaves."</br>"Exactly!" you say.</br>"Exactly what?" the kabouter asks.</br>"In order to free the kabouters, we need to bring down the wrath of the gnomes upon them."</br>"What you are saying is the opposite of sense. Perhaps you\'ve had too much to drink? I can smell it on your breath."</br>"No, no… you have to understand my good… say, I didn\'t catch your name?"</br>"Sergei," the kabouter says. Russian indeed. "And you?" "Gregory. You\'ll have to trust me about this. It\'ll work." "Why would I trust you? I\'ve just met you." Sergei says.</br>"You can trust him," A\'gog says, "because he thinks he\'s hallucinating all of this."</br>"None of you make sense," Sergei says.</br>"Look, let\'s just go build some barricades, throw some rocks at gnomes.</br>You\'ll see."</br>"Well, I do like to throw rocks at gnomes," Sergei concedes.</br>"It\'s settled," you say, as though anything were settled. You pass the lighter to A\'gog and begin to descend the ladder. Soon, A\'gog snuffs the flame and you climb down into a darkness filled with a silence punctuated by horrendous screeching.</br>You count some two hundred rungs before a screech, closer than the others, shatters your nerve. You lose count—and almost your grip—but  then realize that it came from Sergei, above, and not actually from a giant, human-eating bat swooping ever nearer to you in the dark. Unless, of course, there is more to kabouters than you\'ve currently been told.</br>You find the floor and set your feet down, quite excited to be on solid ground—until you remember that you\'re leagues beneath the surface of the earth! At the last minute, you step out of the way, realizing that others are coming down the in the dark.</br>"Let\'s cause some ruckus," A\'gog says as he joins you.</br>"Right then. Sergei, which way to the tunnel to the gnomish city?"</br>"We call them hallways. And the city you speak of is called Hak\'kal." He expels a good bit of phlegm with this last word.</br>"Something in your throat?"</br>"That\'s the city\'s name. Hak\'kal. It\'s where the gnomes live. And the hall is this way. Follow me," he says, and his voice trails off in the darkness.</br>He leads you by talking constantly, and you learn about how the gnomes and the kabouters came to these caverns from elsewhere, hundreds of years ago, displacing the goblins into the lower depths where the mushrooms don\'t grow as abundantly. You learn about how the goblins make an attempt to free themselves once a generation, and that the gnomes are currently on guard for the next attempt.</br>"We\'re far enough from the rest of Underburg that you could probably use that lighter to see," Sergei says. "Actually, here." Something is thrust into your hands that feels like a wet stick. "Light this."</br>The lighter flares, and you realize you\'re holding a stick that looks like it\'s made of a brittle wax. "This is snot, isn\'t it?" you ask as A\'gog sets the torch alight.</br>"Yup," A\'gog says. "Huh."</br>You\'re standing in a natural cavern, certainly the largest and most fantastic that you\'ve ever seen. Everything glitters, and strange formations drip down the walls and dangle from the ceiling. The floor, however, has been leveled.</br>At the edge of your torchlight, you see the beginning of a city that looks like it was made by mad, gigantic bees. It\'s clearly more a hive than it is a distinct series of buildings, and it\'s a hive made of the same waxy snot as your torch.</br>In the other direction, there\'s a hallway. Looks a bit like a service hallway you would find under a modern building, with steam-pipes and all.</br>"Well, let\'s do some damage," you say.</br>You start grabbing rubble from the cavern and piling it, and Sergei starts cementing it together with snot.</br>A\'gog, in the meantime, has pulled a monkey wrench out from somewhere and is going at the pipes with a single-minded determination.</br>It doesn\'t take long before you have a goblin-high wall across the corridor and the pipes and cables have been tangled into confusion.</br>Nor does it take long for the guards to arrive.</br>"Douse the light!" Sergei whispers. "I hear three gnomes coming."</br>You go to smother it against the rock wall, but you\'ve forgotten that the mortar itself is combustible, and soon you stand before a burning barricade! Now you can hear the gnomes running towards you. The three of you gather up rocks and throw them through the flames, laughing with revolutionary joy when you hear one conk off of metal that you take to be a guard\'s helmet. The flames are so high and thick that you cannot see, but at least the gnomes will not see you either. After several minutes of tossing rocks, you retreat.</br>"This way," Sergei says, and grabs you by the arm. You pick up A\'gog and carry him as though he were a toddler, and run into the dark city ahead. You\'re led through a screeching crowd and are told to crawl into a small corridor.</br>"Thank you, my friends," you say to your companions, your heart full of adrenaline—finer perhaps than any drug.</br>"Sip of brandy, calm the nerves?" A\'gog asks, uncorking a bottle and placing it into your hand.</br>"No thanks," you say, surprising yourself. You\'ve no desire to dull the fervor you feel.</br>"What now?" Sergei asks. A fine question.</br>',
    39: 'But several hours go by and the gates never open, the horde never storms forward to lay siege upon the gnomish city. The crowd around you begins  to murmur.</br>"The machine above must not have succeeded. Yi\'ta must have failed." "What does that mean?" you ask.</br>"That we will have to wait another six months before we can try again. Another six months of work, but another six months of training. Come on, shall we?" Gu\'dal places a warm hand on the back of your knee, and the crowd in the room is beginning to drift away, out through various tunnels.</br>"I\'m not sure," you demur. You think about your warm, lumpy bed that waits for you in your tower.</br>But Gu\'dal gives you a look that might be what goblins use to smelt metal. "You were ready to give your life for our cause, but you aren\'t willing to spend six months among us, preparing?"</br>"When you put it that way, it does sound rather foolish," you admit. But somehow it is different. You prefer the thrill of adventure to the routine of labor, regardless of risk. But you suppose that life in a goblin work camp might be adventurous enough, and you steel your resolve. "Alright then, where you lead I shall follow."</br>You join the largest mass of goblins as they leave the large chamber, out into a new hallway. The ceiling remains a comfortably above your head by a foot or so, which you realize must seem cavernously high to the goblins.</br>"Gu\'dal," you hear, "you simply must to introduce me to your British friend here." A spiky, mismatched suit of full plate armor—presumably with a goblin inside—falls into step beside you. "You are British, are you not?"</br>"Perhaps by birth," you reply.</br>"Ah! Of course. How rude of me. The name is Trevor." "Tre\'vortin," Gu\'dal corrects.</br>"No, just Trevor will do."</br>This is clearly an argument that the two have had before.</br>"Gregory, meet Trevor. Trevor here is an Anglophile." The disdain in her voice is quite plain.</br>The suit of plate mail thrusts a spiked gauntlet towards you, which you look at uncertainly.</br>"Right," the helmet says, then two steel fists rise up and the helmet is lifted free of the armor. Underneath is a goblin fellow that you dare say is dashing, with a cute pug nose and rather kind eyes.</br>For the rest of your walk, Trevor regales you with tales of travel throughout the caverns of Undereurope, and Gu\'dal walks silently. You\'re not certain, but you think she might be sulking.</br>Just as Trevor is explaining the nature of Scandinavian ghasts, you step out of a tunnel into a cavern the size of, well, the size of a gigantic cavern. It\'s lit intermittently by gaslight, and you realize that there is an entire town enclosed within.</br>And what a town! It is built vertically as well as horizontally, the air strung across with ropes and nets, some ropes so dense together that they form what look like nothing more than hives. Goblins of all sorts clamber along lines, swing through the air, crawl across the walls and ceiling. On the ground, the wargoblins are stripping their armor and hiding it amongst stray machinery and kitchen supplies. Many trade their armor for pickaxes and walk, no spring in their step, out into side tunnels. Back to work, you presume.</br>"Welcome to Haddlelint," Gu\'dal says. "Haddlelint," you repeat.</br>"It means ‘primary goblin camp\' in Gnomish," Trevor explains, then places a hand affectionately on your knee.</br>"Oh."</br>',
    40: 'You leave Gu\'dal behind as you walk around the corner, uncertain what fate might hold in store for you. The corridor opens up into a large natural cavern, reinforced with stone-block pillars. Stalactites grin down at you, some of them held together with steel bracing. The unmistakable smell of opium smoke lingers in the air.</br>Before you stand two gnomes. What else could they be? They are nearly twice as tall as the goblins—their eyes reaching to your waist. You\'re curious to see their faces, but these two guards wear elaborate helmets that remind you of nothing so much as diver\'s helmets, only with dark tinted glass over their faces. Each holds a rifle of the most bizarre model you\'ve ever seen, gleaming bright copper and brass with crystals mounted along the bore in strange configurations.</br><img src="images/40.png" alt=""></br>The guards are placed on either side of a set of impressive steel doors, inlaid with ornamentation in floral patterns. For a moment you are taken with the fierce desire to wake up, to return to your bedroom and your vices.</br>Upon seeing you, the guards aim their weapons directly at you. "Qui êtes-vous?" one of them, the slightly pudgy one, asks.</br>"I\'m sorry?" you say.</br>"Who is there?" he—for you presume it to be a he, although you don\'t feel totally confident in your gender assumptions—asks.</br>"My name is Gregory, and I\'ve come from above. I, uh, I\'d like to speak with your leader."</br>The skinnier gnome nods, and turns to a voice-horn embedded into the wall beside the doors. The guard speaks in a language you don\'t recognize, one both guttural and rolling. It\'s a bit like Finnish, but with shorter words.</br>The guard turns his or her ear to the voice-horn, awaiting a reply, then turns back towards you. In a heavy accent, the gnome announces: "Someone will be with you shortly. If you try anything, I will shoot you with this lightrifle."</br>You spend a most stressful five minutes staring intently at the doors of Hak\'kal. But eventually, they open. Beyond, you can see a beautiful, gaslit city. It reminds you a bit of Prague, if Prague were inhabited solely by five- year-old children. The roof of it is beyond your vision, and the chamber is so massive that you nearly believe you have returned, somehow, to the surface of the world.</br>Through the portal walks a self-important guard, walking like a precocious boy-soldier, his rifle swinging in one hand. You identify him as the leader with ease; a remarkable number of badges and medals (is that a political pin from Paris?) adorn the entirety of his uniform, from lapel to trouser-cuff, his bucket-helmet reveals his face and bears a two-hand-high bronze sculpture of himself.</br>"Yes?" His voice is gruff, and he walks up to you without fear as he speaks. He looks you over, and you can tell when he meets your eyes that he doesn\'t see you as much of a threat to him. Despite being twice his height, you tend to agree with this assessment.</br>"I will have an audience with your city\'s ruling body, be it monarch or parliament. I am here as ambassador from the goblins."</br>"Tricked you into that, did they? Well, alright. I\'ll ask for you. Would you like some tea, or some opium, while you wait?"</br>',
    41: '"What sort of vapors?" you ask, curious. "Ether," the taller goblin says.</br>"Where you lead, I shall follow," you say.</br>And what a feat of following! You are on their spry heels for nearly two hours, navigating twisting natural caverns, at one point crawling, before you reach your destination.</br>Your destination is an open cave room that forms an amphitheater of sorts, bedecked in a mind-altering display of flashing color, flame, and scintillating crystals. Your mind tries in vain to form patterns in the noise, yet you seem to be unable to resist the attempt, hoping to find constellations where there just might be none.</br>Suddenly your attention is arrested by a booming voice quite inhuman, even quite ingoblin. "Greetings, wayfarer. Your journey has only begun." You look to the bottom of the theatre and see what might be the gauntest giant you have ever laid eyes upon. Well, you\'ve never actually laid eyes on a giant, but you had always pictured them to be, you know, thick as well as tall. This man—and indeed his manhood is quite clearly displayed—is seven feet tall while seated (and likely, of course, twice that standing!) but as thin, if not thinner, than you.</br>"How\'d you get in here?" you ask, annoyed for some reason. "I had to crawl, and I\'m only like five foot nine. I got my clothes all muddy."</br>Your question seems to catch the giant off guard. "I grew up here," he says.</br>"You\'ve never left this room?"</br>"Perhaps not in body," he says, and you try not to scoff. "But with the use of the holy thak\'narra fungus, one can travel anywhere, for days or years at a time."</br>This gets your attention. Drugs you understand, even if sitting cross- legged and emaciated doesn\'t seem like the indulgent life you\'d hoped for.</br>"Your journey to find peace begins in this room," he says, and a tiny goblin—perhaps a child?—comes to your foot and offers up a murky black tincture in a crystal vial.</br>You uncap it and swallow, excited. You sit, and for fifteen minutes you return to your attempt at tracing constellations in the lights that encircle the room. The drug kicks in, and suddenly everything makes sense. The lights</br>merge in your consciousness, and you realize that they are not separate lights, not really. That they\'re all together, forming a skull. "A skull," you say, to the giant and the goblins. "A skull symbolizes life itself, a skull contains our brains and keeps our head in its proper shape! How lovely, how peaceful!"</br>"You saw a skull?" a voice asks, though you are no longer certain who is talking. It might be you. Or the giant. Or, of course, someone else, like God.</br>"Of course!" you say.</br>"Crap," the voice says. Would God curse? You suppose It might. You  also aren\'t used to believing in God.</br>"Wait, he was British, wasn\'t he?" It says. You would have thought God would have known the answer to that.</br>"Why can\'t you give the British thak\'narra?" says the voice, although It doesn\'t appear to be talking to you.</br>"The British are human, you realize," God says to Itself. "Really? Oh. Oh crap," God replies.</br>Then you die.</br>',
    42: 'You\'ll never know if it was cowardice or reason that drove you to do it, but you throw your hands into the air and take a step back. "I\'ve no idea what I\'ve gotten myself into," you announce.</br>Gu\'dal turns and looks at you, a vile, malicious look that might well keep you awake at night the rest of your days. But as her back is turned, the gnome steps forward and brings a blackjack down on the back of her skull, knocking her top hat onto the pavement. Gu\'dal crumbles in its wake.</br>"You\'ve done the right thing," the gnome tells you. "Now go get drunk, you louse."</br>With something like guilt and something like the relief of oblivion, you journey into an all-night bar to take the gnome\'s sarcastic advice.</br>When you return home the next noon, you stumble upon a tripwire set across your threshold. As your face hits the floor, you hear a sad laugh and your life comes to an immediate end.</br>',
    43: 'The captain walks back towards the voice-horn and shouts a series of unintelligible commands into it. He then turns and smiles at you, his teeth white and straight and, unlike the goblins\', protruding from gums as pink as your own.</br>A few moments later, two fairly small gnomes come through the gates, bearing a fine silver tray with a china tea set between the two of them. One of the cups is human-sized, and this is filled for you. The wonderful aroma of tea leaves fills the chamber.</br>You sit cross-legged upon the ground and sip at the cup, relaxing quite a bit. How civil these gnomes are, you think.</br>',
    44: 'You\'re shown to a human-sized cot in a shadowy corner of the cavern, far from any side tunnels and obscured by layers and layers of net. "The gnomes won\'t know that you\'re here," Gu\'dal explains, "because if they find you, they\'ll take you away."</br>It\'s with that ominous warning that you begin your time in Haddlelint. The goblins here keep time by the brightness of their lamps; each is controlled by a central clockwork that shuts off or dims them at night, slowly bringing them to full-bright at noon. There are no other timepieces, but you learn to adjust.</br>You\'re woken early each morning by a now-playful Gu\'dal, who sometimes dumps water on your head, sometimes yells Goblin obscenities in your ear. You\'re led off down side tunnels—chosen so as to avoid gnomish observation—and she teaches you the rudiments of cane-fighting.</br>Despite outweighing her perhaps six times over, she wallops you soundly for three months before you are able to hold your own.</br>"Remember," she says one day as you practice, "if a rifle-gnome points her lightrifle at you, dodge left. Always left. It works more often than right."</br>Then, at noon each day, Gu\'dal leaves for her work shift and you hide in the main room. Most often, you play tiles with the goblins, who have dozens—if not hundreds—of drinking games that you explore.</br>But you find yourself drinking less than you had on the surface, certainly no more than two flasks a day. Which is not to say that the goblin sugar- mushroom brandy isn\'t good. It is. You just find yourself taken by this new sense of self, this image of yourself as a warrior.</br>And when Gu\'dal returns in the evenings, and the two of you take long walks through the tunnels, you find yourself more and more taken with her. Five months into your stay, you\'re physically fit, practically sober (no more than six shots in an evening!), and quite resoundingly in love with your mentor, who is almost two feet tall and has claws for fingernails.</br>She seems fond of you as well. No longer does she wake you with sharp jabs in the underside of your ribs. Rather, she licks your cheek, or bounces on your chest as though it were a trampoline. One morning she walks alongside you on stilts, then places her arm around your waist. You nearly faint with happiness.</br>Six months pass faster than you realized could be possible, and it is the last night before the horde gathers once more. You sit with Gu\'dal, perched on a net forty feet from the cavern floor, and stare at the stalactites above, imagining constellations in their patterns. You pull the silver ring out of your pocket, and consider what to do.</br>',
    45: 'You leap from your perch, and fortunately a small child breaks your fall. You spin about in all directions, everything a blur, and strike about randomly.</br>Screams fill the air and bring bloodlust into your eyes. The lion rends, your cane bludgeons, and soon all of your foes are subdued.</br>The lion peacefully laps at blood that pools on the floor, and A\'gog looks pleased. The bodies of almost a dozen gnomes are scattered about.</br>"We should get out of here," you say, because you\'re afraid you might vomit if you let yourself think about what you\'ve done.</br>"Oh, no. No, we won\'t be going anywhere. More will come, and more shall fall. The great evil city of Hak\'kal will be uprooted like… like if you were to cut the tendrils off a moss. We shall be victorious!"</br>Suddenly, three grown gnomes run into the room, wielding complex and bizarre rifles—adorned with crystals that spin and throw specks of light across the chamber—and wearing full-face helmets covered with darkened glass.</br>You don\'t think—you\'re far too drunk on adrenaline and booze for that— but instead rush them, your cane raised.</br>A purple beam shoots out and glances against your chest, stinging, but you bring your cane down on the faceplate of the gnome who shot you and break glass into his face, destroying his eyes. Soon you\'re joined by A\'gog and his lion, and a second guard falls. The third runs.</br>You make to chase the fleeing figure, but A\'gog stops you. "Let them run," he says, "let them tell the whole city that we are here."</br>"We\'re not going to win this, are we?"</br>"No," A\'gog says, "but they\'ll pay for my life of slavery. I thank you, stranger, for giving yourself to this."</br>"Yeah, well, I kinda thought I was hallucinating it all."</br>A\'gog nods. You pull a final flask from your back pocket, and you drain it.</br>More guards will come. And you will die. But at least you\'ll die in some</br>weird cavern far underground, miles from where you were born, on a grand and twisted adventure, with no ethics to speak of. At least you will die free.</br>Nevertheless, you will die.</br>',
